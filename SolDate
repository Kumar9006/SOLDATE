I heard of SolDate from Solana's founder Anatoly Yakavenko on Coindesk TV. 
He pointed out how it is important for crypto projects to provide solutions beyond trading and finance in order to get more people to understand crypto. 
I was immediately sold to the idea of a dating platform which was an innovative shift to real life use case. 
Blockchain solutions need to solve real life problems beyond the financial world for people to take notice and understand the underlying technology.
 One such solution is finding love, where the value lies beyond money.
A project aimed at revolutionising a whole industry which accounts for 3 billion dollars a year and that's just US.

SolDate - The first ever community owned online dating platform powered by Solana which aims to provide a solution to all the existing problems
 and at the same time intends to bring more users to blockchain ecosystem. I call it, "A solution with a deeper purpose". Difficult times call for
 innovative measures and that's how the idea was born with Covid bringing our social lives to a halt. The team has chosen to stay anonymous.
 The team claims to have over 6 years of blockchain involvement and more than 3 years of combined experience of building web 3.0 apps for clients across the globe.

What is SolDate? 
How is it different? 
What problem is it solving?

SolDate has a perfectly crafted name. 
It rhymes with Soulmate, doesn't it, and also defines its origin 'Solana' and function 'Date' so well. 
Date also happens to be 
the native token and a means of finding a partner without the high gas cost of Ethereum. 

While one canâ€™t deny what technology has done and how digital match-making services have succeeded in turning singles into couples- the convenience and ease provided
 by these apps comes at a high cost.

With rising concerns ranging from scams to harassment to ghosting to data tracking, checks are required to ensure users a transparent and efficient matchmaking ecosystem.
